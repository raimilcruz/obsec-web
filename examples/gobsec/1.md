This example shows how to define the `StringEq` policy using a primitive signature. 

The `login` method receives two arguments: the `secret`
password and the user guess. The `password` argument 
has a declassification policy that allows releasing the 
result of the `==` comparison. The body of the `login`
method adheres to that policy, so the resulting integer 
is public.
