  <Title>1.3: Password policy is full secret</Title>
  <Description>
    This example differs from the first one in that the first argument of the login method (i.e. the real password) is full secret.
     In this case, the implementation of the login does not adhere to the policy of password because it is using the == method that is
     not in the public facet, so the resulting type of the login method body is a secret integer.
     Hence the method implementation result type is not subtype of the method signature return type, deriving in a type error.
     Feel free to change the login method signature return type to Int@H and then the program will be well-typed, meaning the result is secret.
