 The password policy now indicates that information about the password can be done public by calling 1) the hash method over the password,
     and then 2) to compare the result with a public integer. The program adheres to the policy, so it is well-typed.
     Any variation to the implementation of the login method that does not respect the policy will be ill-typed.
    For instance, change the conditional expression to password.hash().+(1).==(guess.hash().+(1))
